USED :
PHP 

ran on Apache server and MariaDB database with the help of xamp ;

every function is working and all the objectives have been completed ;

the new UI has been made for User_signup folder ( part of project only ) ... this can be directly extended to the admin_signup folder .

only con of this project is 
1. use of redundant code 
2. file organisation could hav been better , i can still do it but avoiding it to get over my perfectionism
